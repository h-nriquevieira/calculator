# calculator

A simple calculator created to practice javascript, css and html. [Click here] for a live demo.

This was my first attempt at responsive design, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Had some trouble testing, as simulating devices using dev tools doesn't really represent what it looks like on the actual device.

As far as what I got to practice, by far the most important thing was structring the actual logic. Figuring out how to store values, how to pass operators, how to account for every single way I could imagine a user would input data was a big challenge, and a lot of fun.

The layout wasn't a huge challenge, but it gave me a few headaches. Got to learn a little bit about how webkit handles vh units.

Overall, I learned a lot. I wonder how much better I will be able to write this in the future.
